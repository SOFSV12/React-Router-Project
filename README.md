# React Router Project

During the process of learning React and its core Features i was able to build a react router with my instructor, this is a single page application with multi-pages which prevents the default behaviour of a browser refreshing when a user wants to redirect to a seperate page, we were also able to implement programmtic redirection after a certain action was completed such as a form submission.

The project was also deployed on firebase, and lazy loading was implemented for optimization.
